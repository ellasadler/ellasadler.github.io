    <h2>The Genre Talk</h2>
        <p>Everyone's got a favorite genre. If you are a seasoned reader, then this may come as no surprise and you may have already established what your favorite is. For the beginners, it may be harder to identify right away.</p>
        <p>This website focuses heavily on romance reads. That being said, many of these books are also fantasy, thriller, and contemporary! On this page you will find my GoodReads account linked, and all the specific genre information can be found there.</p>
