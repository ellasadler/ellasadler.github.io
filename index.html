    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I am from Ann Arbor, Michigan. I am 22 years old and am a senior at the University of Miami. I was once a Meteorology and Marine Science double major. When I was a sophomore I switched over to journalism due to my love of writing that I could no longer ignore.</p> 

    <p>I dream of writing my own TV series or novel one day. With a minor in Motion Pictures and a love for reading, this dream has developed in the past few years. I used to read a lot when I was much younger, but in high school I stopped due to my rigorous schedule. When quarantine hit, I decided to pick up books again.</p>
    
    <p>Ever since I got back into reading, I have read hundreds of books and am well equipped with recommendations. My favorite genres are romance and fantasy, but Iâ€™ll typically read anything that strikes me as interesting. I just love how fictional stories take me into a whole new world. I like to escape real life with the lives these fictional characters live.</p>
